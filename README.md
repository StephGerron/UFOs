# UFO Sightings with Javascript

Build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

Customize the webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. Watch the video to learn more about the specific data project you’ll be working on.
